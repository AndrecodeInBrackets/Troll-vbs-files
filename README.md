# Troll .Vbs Files

Here we have some .vbs files (and .bat files) to troll your friends

## Important
Don't try at school!

## Duplicating popups (Pack 1)
 The first pack is about a window duplicating. To get rid of it, just close the command prompt that is shown. Remember that you have to close the popups manualy to fully
 escape the RAM eater!
 
 ## Un-close-able popup (Pack 2)
 The 2nd pack is a never closeable window. To close it for real, you have to open the task manager (ctrl + shift + esc). What will happen is that the task manager
 forcefully closes the popup so it will not run anymore (explaind for dummies)
